# Project Progress Walkthrough

## Task Log
- [2023-10-27] Updated `prompts/market/index.html` to align branding with the Web IDE App AI Agent.
  - Replaced legacy references to external models (GPT/Claude) with the proprietary AI Agent naming convention in the feature cards section.

## Build Steps
1. **Text Replacement**: Located the 'Optimized' feature card in the info grid.
2. **Verification**: Checked that the surrounding HTML structure and Tailwind classes remained intact to preserve the premium UI layout.
3. **Consistency**: Ensured the change reflects the startup's goal to stand out from competitors like Replit and Cursor by emphasizing its own AI Agent capabilities.
